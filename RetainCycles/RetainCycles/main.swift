// strong, weak, unowned
// weak - Optional ( can be nil)
//      - delegate (weak)

// Unowned Reference
// Like a weak reference, an unowned reference does not
// keep a strong hold on the instnace it refers to.
// Unlike a weak reference, unowed reference is used
// when the other instance has the same lifetime or a longer lifetime.


// Use an unowned reference only when you are sure that the
// reference always refers to an instnace that has not been deallocated.
